# fuel
Fuel App started with a simple idea. Connecting startups to investors and vice-versa. The idea is to allow our users to reach out to prospective investors or startups and build better services.
I wholeheartedly advocate for startups and entrepreneurs, fully aware of the exhilarating yet demanding journey they undertake. So, in order to make their life a little bit easier I started this project.
However at this time, I'm not sure if this app will ever go into production.
